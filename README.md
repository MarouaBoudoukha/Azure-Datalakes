## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts adapted from the Azure SDK for Python - Data Lake Storage Samples. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the process of testing, understanding, and adapting these scripts to import files into Azure Data Lake Storage from a specified Google Drive folder.

## Objectives
Testing and Understanding Scripts: Scripts provided by Azure's official documentation were tested and understood.
GitHub Repository Creation: This repository serves as the container for the adapted code.
Script Adaptation: The scripts have been modified to facilitate the import of files from this Google Drive folder into Azure Data Lake Storage.
Setup and Configuration

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Azure account with access to Data Lake Storage Gen2
Access to the specified Google Drive folder
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone [repository-url]
Install required Python packages:
Copy code

## Configuration
Ensure that you have the necessary Azure credentials (Storage Account Name, Access Key) and configure them in the scripts.
Modify the script parameters to point to the correct file paths or directories in your Azure Data Lake Storage and Google Drive folder.
Usage

Run the individual scripts to perform actions like file upload, download, listing, etc. Detailed instructions for each script are provided within the script files themselves.
